## Synopsys

Now that you are gaining an understanding on how to manipulate life, it's about time to consider morality. Weâ€™ll also try to isolate our first biomaterial. For that we need centrifugal force to take your samples for a spin.

## Schedule

* Bioethics
* Centrifuge Design
* Practicals
  * Field research
  * Peer 2 Peer reviewing

## Devices

> WARNING: Centrifuges are dangerous machines. Always make sure you detach the rotor from the motor when testing the device. Attach something to the motor only after you are confident that you have the machine working properly.

### Centrifuge

* [BHA_Centrifuge repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Centrifuge)
