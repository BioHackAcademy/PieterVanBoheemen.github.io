## Synopsys

It's time to digg into DNA. Let's explore the characteristics of the most fundamental information carrier in life and try to hack it. In the practical we will extract DNA and perform a finger print.

## Schedule

* Genetics
* Biosensing
* Thermocycler Design
* Gel box and power supply Design
* Practicals
  * DNA extraction
  * DNA profiling

## Devices

For this week's practicals we need 3 devices:

### Thermocycler

* [BHA_Thermocycler repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Thermocycler)
