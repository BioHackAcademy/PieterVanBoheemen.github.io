## Synopsys

Build your own incubator, a constant environment for growing microbes. A crash course Arduino programming and digital electronics. During the practical we will start isolating microbes ourselves.

## Schedule

* Biomaterials
* Coding Arduino
* Digital Electronics
* Incubator Design
* Practicals
  * Isolating microbes

## Devices

Living organisms need a nice and comfort environment to grow in.
