## Synopsys

Build your own incubator, a constant environment for growing microbes. A crash course Arduino programming and digital electronics. During the practical we will start isolating microbes ourselves.

## Schedule

* [Biomaterials](/bha2/class/3/pdf/1 Materials of Life.pdf)
* Coding Arduino - skipped to next week
* Digital Electronics - skipped to next week
* [Creative Bio Equipment](/bha2/class/3/pdf/Creative Equipment.pdf)
* [Incubator Design](/bha2/class/3/pdf/4 Incubator design.pdf)
* [BioStrike DDSS](/bha2/class/3/pdf/BioStrike - DDSS.pdf)
* Practicals
  * Isolating microbes

## Devices

Living organisms need a nice and comfort environment to grow in.
