## Synopsys

This week we will start growing microbes under controlled conditions. During the class you will also get to know the fundamentals of microbiology. Weâ€™ll use our purple pigment bacteria as a standard, but you can also choose your own favourite biological agent. Next, we start setting up your own documentation site and dive a bit more into analog electronics.

## Schedule

* Microbiology
* Bio design / art
* Documentation
* Analog electronics & Magnetic Stirrer design
* Practicals
  * Cultivating microbes

## Devices

In order to grow microbes in liquids, we will start building a Magnetic Stirrer.
