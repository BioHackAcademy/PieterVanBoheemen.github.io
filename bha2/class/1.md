## Synopsys

Welcome to BHA 2. We will start with a short history of the Biohacking field. Next, you will learn how to design objects in 2D and 3D and transform them into real objects with a lasercutter or 3D printer. As a demo we will make basic lab utilities, such as tube racks. Finally, we will take a first look at electronics.

## Schedule

* Introduction
