## Participants

Each participant in the BioHack Academy creates a documentation page to share their experience, designs and results. 

Here you may find [the instructions to create your own Github page](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_DocumentationSite). You are also free to choose any other documentation / blog platform. 

Please send the link to your documentation site as soon as it is setup to [roland@waag.org](mailto:roland@waag.org).
