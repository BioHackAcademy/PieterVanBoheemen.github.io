## Synopsys

Microbes can generate a lot of data. Especially 3D data is beautiful and essential to understand. We will give enzyme analysis a try. Next, spectroscopy is a great tool for monitoring the growth and production in your bioreactor. We will make our own light source and detector setup. The class is about other analytical techniques too.

## Schedule

* Bioinformatics
* Biocultura (by Andrea Polli)
* Spectrometer Design 
* Practicals
  * [Iodine Clock Reaction](/bha5/class/8/iodine-clock-reaction/)
  * Optional: PyMOL

## Devices

This week we will build a spectrometer. We have created 2 spectrometer designs, you may choose which design to build. The Webcam based device is the simplest.

### Webcam-based spectrometer

For fast and easy graphical analysis.

* [BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer)

### Photodiode array-based photospectrometer

This is a more precise analytical instrument. Why not hack it into a flow cell spectrometer?

* [BHA_Spectrophotometer repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Spectrophotometer)
