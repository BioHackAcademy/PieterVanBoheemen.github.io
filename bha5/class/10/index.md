## Synopsys

The final presentations of 10 weeks biohacking, broadcasted live on April 3rd, 2018. 
* Final presentations: [Full Video](https://vimeo.com/265259253)
  * [05:04](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=5m4s) - Anna Pelgrim (Amsterdam) - Architecture of Cure - The aim of this project is using natural elements through the senses (smell, sound, and sight) to research the effect of nature on stress reduction and also recovery. Using a distiller/rotary evaporator to make essential oils from forest material which have been proven to reduce stress, the aim is to create stress-reducing scents for people to take with them.
  * [13:21](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=13m21s) - Malu Lücking (Amsterdam) - invisible identity - A set of experiments about our relation to the sense of smell.
  * [21:43](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=21m43s) - Youngah Seoung (Tokyo) - Are you in love at the cellular level? - I want to check the compatibility of romantic partners using microorganisms coexisting on our body.
  * [30:56](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=30m56s) - Jan Köhler (Amsterdam) - What are you planting to wear? - Wearable plants to satisfy biophilic needs.
  * [44:45](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=44m45s) - Jun Nishimura (Tokyo) - never die - I made a candle by mixing in my sperm to express the infinity of life. I want to give others the chance to think about death from a different view.
  * [49:46](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=49m46s) - Hiroki Kaimoto (Tokyo) - Mushikui Music - In my project, I am trying to make original punch cards with bugs. By tracing the bug-eaten holes, the music box will play music the bugs have made.“Mushikui” (虫食い) means holes made by bugs that have eaten clothes or paper in Japanese.
  * [57:26](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=57m26s) - Kazuhide Hane (Tokyo) - What is bioinformatics? What can we do by using it? - I want to present my knowledge about bioinformatics. By doing so, I want to imagine our fantastic future possibilities!
  * [01:05:16](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h5m16s) - Divid Didonato (Albuquerque) - BioHack Board - This video is a breakdown of the Bio Hack circuit board covering technical issues, end-user experience, and example boards that display different ways of approaching circuit board design.

  * [01:17:12](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h17m12s) - Matthijs de Block (Amsterdam) - Copy Me (The existential being of non-life) - NEST is a group of non-biological organisms that interacts with human behaviour. These soft robots explore the question of life, technology and its relation to us, humans, in a futuristic society.
  * [01:28:03](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h28m03s) - Yohei Inokuchi (Tokyo) - Quorum Light - Visualizationof Communication - This light glows when people gather and communicate. I want to use the bacteria Vibrio fischeri that glows when they gather and the cell density becomes high. If people gather around this light and communicate, a stage under the light rotates and Vibrio fischeri gather at the center, and glow.
  * [01:31:29](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h31m29s) - Keisuke Yamada (Tokyo) - Personality of slime molds - As we, humans, are quite different from each other, slime molds are also different among media. I tried to investigate if slime molds have individual personalities.
  * [01:40:40](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h40m40s) - Bart Peeters (Amsterdam) - Can slime mold play pacman - Since slime mold has some form of intelligence in finding the quickest route in a maze, I was wondering if we could interact with it and play a game of pacman with it. I have developed an agar printer to plot the maze and a camera system to detect the location of the slime mold. This location is fed back into the pacman game. Here the user can interact, though very slowly, with the slime mold. 
  * [01:54:40](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=1h54m40s) - Alexander Rose (Amsterdam) - Bio-hacking the glacier - My project aims to highlight the role snow algae plays in the bioalbedo melting affect on glaciers worldwide, and to identify how we can hack this resource in the wild and in situ.
  * [02:01:29](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=2h01m29s) - Nel Thomas (Copenhagen) - Fabriel - Creating a biomaterials accessory range - Fabriel is based around using fablab tools and equipment to create a range of materials that incorporate waste around the lab.Mainly material waste in the form of plastics and wood. The plan is to make a bag using a new material I have been working on made from bio-plastic & fibres ( wood processing with added cellulose).Then to add a thin mycelia leather to other areas of the bag as well as incorporating Kombucha that has been eco-dyed to give this 100% waste material bag a more modern take.  
  * [02:15:34](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=2h15m34s) - Laura Olalde (Amsterdam) - Kombucha Genomics hosts Changing Skin - Kombucha Genomics is a joint communitary project by Counter Culture Labs and Biocurious. Its main objective is to study Kombucha. Curiously during the process, Kombucha managed somehow to “study me” from its perspective and proposing itself as a hostess for Changing skin, a personal trip around fermentation, resilience and transformation. 
  * [02:30:21](https://vimeo.com/265259253#t=2h30m21s) - Johan R (Tokyo) - Grow Your Lab and Eat It - I would like to experiment with local fibers, bacteria and fungi to create sustainable bio materials and edible by-products such as kombucha leather, mycelium bricks, etc.
