The aim of this project is using natural elements through the senses (smell, sound, and sight) to research the effect of nature on stress reduction and also recovery. Using a distiller/rotary evaporator to make essential oils from forest material which have been proven to reduce stress, the aim is to create stress-reducing scents for people to take with them.
