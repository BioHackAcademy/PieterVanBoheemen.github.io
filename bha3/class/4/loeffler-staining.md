## Goal

Visualize cell nuclei in eukaryote cells.

## Materials

* Gas burner
* 95% alcohol
* Loeffler's methylene blue solution
* Tap water
* Bucket or beaker glass
* Blotting paper (alternatively: Tork roll or toilet paper)
* Clear nail polish
* Acetone
* Cotton swab

## Composition of the stain

* Methylene Blue			          	3.0 g
* Potassium Hydroxide KOH, 10%		1.0 ml
* Ethanol, 95%			         		300.0 ml

## Method

1. Prepare a drop of sample on your microscope slide according to our [Method](/bha3/class/4/preparing-slides/)
2. Air dry the sample for 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Soak the cells in a drop of 95% alcohol to dehydrate the cells
4. Air dry the sample for 5 to 10 minutes, make sure all the alcohol is evaporated
5. Fixate the cells by quickly moving the object glass through a flame.
6. Let the sample cool down.
7. Add the Loeffler's solution for about 60 seconds.
8. Remove excess stain by bathing / dipping your glass slide into a beaker glass / bucket with tap water.
9. Remove excess water using blotting paper.
10. Let the slide air dry to get rid of the remaining water.
11. Put 2 drops of clear nail polish onto the sample.
12. Cover the sample with a cover slide.
13. Try to get rid of air bubbles by putting light pressure on the cover slide.
14. Remove excess nail polish with a cotton swab with acetone.
15. Take a look at the sample through the microscope with the diaphragm fully open.
