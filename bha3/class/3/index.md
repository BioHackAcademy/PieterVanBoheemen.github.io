## Synopsys

Build your own incubator, a constant environment for growing microbes. A crash course Arduino programming and digital electronics. During the practical we will start isolating microbes ourselves and do screening for antibiotics effects.

## Schedule

* Physiology
* Creative Bio Equipment
* Digital Electronics 
* Incubator Design
* BioStrike
* Practicals
  * Isolating microbes
  * Antibiotics screening
  * Arduino coding

## Devices

Living organisms need a nice and comfort environment to grow in.

## Bill of Materials

This device is the first device in the course that makes use of an Arduno and digital electronics. You may either choose to connect all the components manually, or build the device on top of the BioHack Academy board. Make sure you order the parts in time!

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Incubator materials](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Incubator/blob/master/BoM.md)
