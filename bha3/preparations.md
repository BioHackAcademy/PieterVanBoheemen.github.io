In order to hit the ground running, please make sure you have taken care of the following:

## Hardware
* Laptop computer running Linux, Mac OS X or Windows
* Arduino UNO microcontroller + USB cable or [a cheaper equivalent board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems#Arduino_footprint-compatible_boards) such as Freeduino, Seeeduino or Sparkfun Redboard
  * We also welcome other kinds of MCUs like Raspberry, Particle, BeagleBone, Galileo, etc, but you'll have to write the code and do the wiring from scratch
  * Also check the [suppliers page](/suppliers/)
* For those of you that are planning to make things at home (otherwise provided in the lab): soldering iron, multimeter, helping hand, solder and heat shrink ([iPrototype](https://iprototype.nl/products/accessoires/tools/Heat-Shrink-Kit))
* M3 [DIN84](http://www.bevestigingsmateriaal.nl/bevestigingsmateriaal/bouten-schroeven/zaagsnede-kop/cilinderkopschroef-din-84/106) or [DIN933](http://www.bevestigingsmateriaal.nl/bevestigingsmateriaal/bouten-schroeven/buitenzeskant-kop/tapbouten-din-933/61) (what ever you prefer) bolts and nuts [DIN934](http://www.bevestigingsmateriaal.nl/bevestigingsmateriaal/moeren/zeskantmoer-din-934/75) in several lengths, such as 10 mm (most used), 20 mm and 30 mm. 

## Software
* Text or code editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Xcode, gedit, etc
* [Arduino IDE 1.6.7](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for programming the Arduino microcontroller
* [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org) for parametric 3D design
* SketchUp version 8 [Mac](http://www.oldapps.com/mac/sketchup.php), [Win](http://filehippo.com/download_sketchup/download/2f2d0bce86e6554b6df98772ca7200a2/), [Linux (Needs Wine)](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=21290), for 3D drawing. Newer versions are not better, and not compatible.
  * [SVG export plugin](https://code.google.com/p/sketchup-svg-outline-plugin/downloads/list) for exporting to lasercutter compatible file format. You will need version 0.99 for Sketchup 8, so choose "sketchup-svg-outlines-plugin-0.99.zip" from the list
  * [STL export plugin](http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/sketchup-stl) for exporting to 3D printer compatible file format
* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) for documenting electronic circuits. You may use EagleCad or KiCad too, but the usage is not taught in the course
* [InkScape](https://www.inkscape.org/en/) for editing vector drawings
* [Cura](http://software.ultimaker.com/) for operating the 3D printer (Ultimakers and Printrbot)

## Cloudware
* Register an account on the following website:
  * [GitHub.org](http://www.github.org) for sharing your code and after the second class you will set up your personal academy page using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) 
  * [Youmagine.com](http://www.youmagine.com) for sharing 3D designs
  * [cloud.netfabb.com](http://cloud.netfabb.com) for fixing broken STL files
  * [issuu.com](http://www.issuu.com) for sharing PDFs under Creative Commons license
  * [fablab.waag.org](http://fablab.waag.org) for documenting fab moments in the Amsterdam Fablab
  * [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com) for commenting on the BioHack Academy syllabus

## Wetware
In case you wish to do experiments at home you will need the following equipment, otherwise these will be provided for in the lab:

* Fridge, freezer and stove
* Pressure cooker (6 Liters or more)
* Empty glass marmalade or vegetable jars
* Pasteur Transfer Pipettes (disposible single use are fine), 15 mL volume pipettes (don't forget the pipetting balloon) and micropipettes (Gilson, Pipetman or go for cheap Huawei via Alibaba)
* A scale, 1 gram accuracy will do for most of the work. Perhaps also consider having a gold scale for smaller amounts [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xgold+scale&_nkw=gold+scale&_sacat=0).
* [Labogaz 206](http://www.campingaz.com/RU/p-22842-labogaz-206.aspx)
* Lab coats

That's it, you're all set!
