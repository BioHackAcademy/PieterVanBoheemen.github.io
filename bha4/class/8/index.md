## Synopsys

Now that you are gaining an understanding on how to manipulate life, it's about time to consider morality.

## Schedule

* Bioethics
* Spectrometer Design
* Practicals
  * Open Lab


## Devices

This week we will build a spectrometer. We have created 2 spectrometer designs, you may choose which design to build. The Webcam based device is the simplest.

### Webcam-based spectrometer

For fast and easy graphical analysis.

* [BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer)

### Photodiode array-based photospectrometer

This is a more precise analytical instrument. Why not hack it into a flow cell spectrometer?

* [BHA_Spectrophotometer repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Spectrophotometer)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Webcam Spectrophotometer materials](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer)
