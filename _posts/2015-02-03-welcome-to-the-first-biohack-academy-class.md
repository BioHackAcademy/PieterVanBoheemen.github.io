Welcome class!

Thanks a lot for embarking on this exciting journey into the world of biohacking. It's going to be an intense ride, simultaniously run on three continents. By the end of the 10 weeks course you will become a true biohacker, a master of both bio and maker speak. Growing your own biomaterials in your biofactory will become your second nature.

Before we will welcome you in the Open Wetlab in Amsterdam, you will need to take care of a few preparations. This will make sure we can hit the ground running. Check out the [Preparations](/biofactory/preparations/) page how to prep your computer and what basic tools to get. The Wetware section is only relevant to those of you who are planning to do experiments at home. When you plan to do experiments only in the Open Wetlab, we already got you covered.

Apart from the general preparations, we highly encourage you to take a look at the instructions for the first class: [Incubator](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/). In case you want to start constructing the device right after the first lecture on the 17th, make sure you start with ordering the materials as suggested in the [Bill of Materials](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/incubator-materials/) soon. Keep an eye out for the shipping times, and feel free to look for alternatives if needed. For any questions about that, please use the Disqus commenting section at the bottom of that page.

So just 2 more weeks until we start! Meanwhile check the [Waag][waag] website for more info on what's going on in our lab.

Good luck!
