## Goal

In the ocean many organisms produce light. There are also many diffent colors. In this practical we will isolate these bacteria from fresh fish.

## Materials

* 1 Fresh fish
* 4 [Artificial Seawater](/biofactory/annex/cultivation-media/artificial-seawater/) plates, simply add 10% agar before autoclaving
* 100 mL [Artificial Seawater](/biofactory/annex/cultivation-media/artificial-seawater/)
* 2 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks
* Glass spatula
* Inoculation loop
* 100 mL beaker glass with some 95% ethanol
* Gas burner
* Air pump, tube and diffuser

## Method

1. Sterilize a inoculation loop in a flame
2. When it is cooled down, scrape the loop along the skin of the fish
3. Streak the loop onto the plate
4. Repeat this procedure onto a second plate
5. Incubate one plate at RT(24&deg; C) and one in the fridge (8&deg; C)
6. Take a look at your plates in total darkness after 2 days or more
7. As soon as you can observe colonies, restreak these on fresh plates
8. As soon as all colonies look the same, you may assume you have a pure culture
9. Sub culture a colony in a 25 mL ASW liquid medium in a Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate at 24&deg; C.
10. Put the tube with diffuser in the flask and turn on the air pump
