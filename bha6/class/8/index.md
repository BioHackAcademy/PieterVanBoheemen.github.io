## Synopsys

This week we have a couple of Guest Lectures: Sarah Adkins & Julian Stadon!
Next to that, there's an introduction into specrometry.
Spectroscopy is a great tool for monitoring the growth and production in your bioreactor. We will make our own light source and detector setup. The class is about other analytical techniques too.

## Agar Art Challenge

Speaker Sarah Adkins challenges all BioHack Academy participants to send in designs for agar art.
*  Send in your agar art design on the [Forum](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/Forum/issues/35)
*  Hear more about her request here in the [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/325723286)

## Devices

This week we will build a spectrometer. We have created 2 spectrometer designs, you may choose which design to build. The Webcam based device is the simplest.

### Webcam-based spectrometer

For fast and easy graphical analysis.

* [BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Webcam_Spectrophotometer)

### Photodiode array-based photospectrometer

This is a more precise analytical instrument. Why not hack it into a flow cell spectrometer?
