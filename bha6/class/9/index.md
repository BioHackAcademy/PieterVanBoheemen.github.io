## Synopsys

Traditionally the last BHA lecture covers some interesting topic with guest lectures. This time its a special class on the topic of bio-digital games and media, with experts from the field. 

## Schedule

* Biotic Games introduction - Euglena Spaceships [PDF](/bha5/class/9/pdf/9.1 Biotic Games at Waag.pdf) - [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/261943580)
* Wim van Eck & Maarten Lamers (Leiden University) - Organism Involved Computer Games [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/261943628)
* Jan-Maarten Luursema - Planet Andi [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/261944053)
* Raphael Kim (Queen Mary University) - Bio-digital interactions and Slow Biotic Games [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/262571768)
* Syringe pump and peristaltic pump design [PDF](/bha5/class/9/pdf/9.2 Pumps design.pdf) - [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/261944564)

## Devices

This week you can build two types of pumps. As with the other projects, each of the devices has its own github repository.

### Some notes on the source files and designs
* Code: We have included the LiquidCrystal_I2C library. However, as there are multiple libraries named LiquidCrystal_I2C around on the web, if you have included one in your Arduino libraries directory it can result in a conflict (errors during compilation). Temporarily remove the library from your Arduino libraries directory.
* Peristaltic pump: the design of the pump depends on the diameter of the tube. In case you use a different type, you will need to adjust the diameters. In our design we used HelixMarkâ„¢ tubes (internal diameter 6.35 mm; external diameter 9.55 mm)
* Syringe pump: the mounting interface between the pump and the syringe depends on the type of syringe you use. In our design we used a MediWare 60mL syringe (REF: I3 040800).

### Syringe pump

This pump is best for moving small volumes of liquids, on at a time.

### Peristaltic pump

This pump is best continuously moving volumes of liquids.
