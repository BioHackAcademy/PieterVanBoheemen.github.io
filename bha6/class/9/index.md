## Synopsys
This week is all about finishing your project in sight of the BioHack Academy graduation presentations next week. In the lecture, we'll talk about How to Continue after the BioHack Academy, some examples of innovation in the context of biohack spaces and biohackers, and the pumps and bioreactor design.

## Schedule

* How to continue after the BioHack Academy - [PDF](bha6/class/9/pdf/9.1 - How to Continue after the BioHack Academy.pdf)
* Biohacking and innovation - [PDF](bha6/class/9/pdf/9.2 Biohacking and innovation.pdf)
* Pumps design - [PDF](bha6/class/9/pdf/9.3 Pumps design.pdf)
* Biohacking and innovation - [PDF](bha6/class/9/pdf/9.4 Bioreactor.pdf)

## Devices

This week you can build two types of pumps. As with the other projects, each of the devices has its own github repository.

### Some notes on the source files and designs
* Code: We have included the LiquidCrystal_I2C library. However, as there are multiple libraries named LiquidCrystal_I2C around on the web, if you have included one in your Arduino libraries directory it can result in a conflict (errors during compilation). Solution: Temporarily remove the library from your Arduino libraries directory.
* Peristaltic pump: the design of the pump depends on the diameter of the tube. In case you use a different type, you will need to adjust the diameters. In our design we used HelixMarkâ„¢ tubes (internal diameter 6.35 mm; external diameter 9.55 mm)
* Syringe pump: the mounting interface between the pump and the syringe depends on the type of syringe you use. In our design we used a MediWare 60mL syringe (REF: I3 040800).

### Syringe pump

This pump is best for moving small volumes of liquids, on at a time.

### Peristaltic pump

This pump is best continuously moving volumes of liquids.
