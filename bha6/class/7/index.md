## Synopsys

This week we'll focus on bioinformatics and the centrifuge.

Weâ€™ll also try to isolate our first biomaterial using centrifugatino.

## Schedule

* Bioinformatics - [PDF](/bha6/class/7/pdf/7.1 Bioinformatics.pdf/) - [VIDEO 1](https://vimeo.com/323427214) - [VIDEO 2](https://vimeo.com/323427631)
* Centrifuge design - [PDF](/bha6/class/7/pdf/7.2 Centrifuge design.pdf/) - [VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/323427966)
* Practicals
  * Peer 2 Peer reviewing:

  > Give constructive Feedback on the personal project of at least 5 fellow BHA participants, based on their Midterm Presentation, as well as documentation sites. Slides. Reviewing takes place on the [Forum](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/Forum/issues/)

  * [Chloroplast isolation](/bha6/class/7/chloroplast-isolation/)

  > WARNING: Centrifuges are dangerous machines. Always make sure you detach the rotor from the motor when testing the device. Attach something to the motor only after you are confident that you have the machine working properly.
