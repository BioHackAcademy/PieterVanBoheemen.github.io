## Bioreactor extensions

Can't believe the Academy ended? Still aching for more biohacks? After graduating you are most welcome to continue your projects in the Open Wetlab any time. And don't forget about our weekly Open Evening.

Become a member of the [Open Wetlab Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Dutch-DIY-Bio/) to stay up to date on workshops and other activities.

Here's some suggestions to keep on hacking:

* Easy: Water proof temp sensor, like [DS18B20](https://www.iprototype.nl/products/components/sensors/waterproof-DS18B20-digital-temp-sensor)
* Moderate: add a pH sensor, like [SEN0169](http://dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Analog_pH_Meter_Pro_SKU:SEN0169)
* Difficult: DIY Gas chromatograph
* Expert: DIY DNA sequencer
* Post your next level hacks in the comments below:
