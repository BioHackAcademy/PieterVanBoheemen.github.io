## Synopsys

In order to scale up our BioFactory, we need to stir things up. Production is often limited by mass transport, so the stirrer will fix that. Weâ€™ll explore the basics of bioreactor design too.

## Schedule

* Physical Transport Phenonoma
* Bioreactor Design
* Magnetic Stirrer Design

## Stirrer Design

This week we will build the stirrer. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/6-stirrer/requirements/)
* [SketchUp assembly](/biofactory/class/6/Magnetic-Stirrer-Sketchup.skp)
* [SVG laser cut files](/biofactory/class/6/Magnetic-Stirrer-SVGs.zip)
* [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/6/Magnetic-Stirrer-Fritzing.fz)
