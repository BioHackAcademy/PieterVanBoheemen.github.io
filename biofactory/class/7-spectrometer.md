## Synopsys

Spectroscopy is an essential tool for monitoring the growth and production in your bioreactor. We will make our own light source and detector setup. The class is about other analytical techniques too.

## Schedule

* Acids & Bases
* Spectroscopy & Spectrometry
* Analytical techniques
* Spectrometer Design
* Spectrometry Practical
  * Iron Calibration Curve

## Spectrometer Design

This week we will build the spectrometer. You may choose which design. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/7-spectrometer/requirements/)
* Webcam design
  * [SketchUp assembly](/biofactory/class/7/Webcam-Spectrometer-Sketchup.skp)
  * [SVG laser cut files](/biofactory/class/7/Webcam-Spectrometer-SVGs.zip)

* Photodiode array design
The photodiode array (or linear CCD) files are stored in a [git repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Spectrophotometer) which you can clone or [download as a zip archive](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Spectrophotometer/archive/master.zip)
