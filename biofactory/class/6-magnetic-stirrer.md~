## Synopsys

In order to scale up our BioFactory, we need to stir things up. Production is often limited by mass transport, so the stirrer will fix that. Weâ€™ll explore the basics of bioreactor design too.

## Schedule

* Physical Transport Phenonoma
* Bioreactor Design
* Magnetic Stirrer Design

## Stirrer Design

This week we will build the stirrer. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/6-stirrer/requirements/)
* SketchUp assembly
* SVG laser cut files
* [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/6/Stirrer-Fritzing.fz)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Magnetic Stirrer materials](/biofactory/class/6-magnetic-stirrer/stirrer-materials/)

## Assignment

Design your bioreactor dimensions and fluxes.

## Additional reading and hacking

* Physical Transport Phenonoma
* Bioreactor Design
* Magnetic Stirrer
  * [TeklaLabs](http://www.teklalabs.org/magnetic-stirrer/)

## Feeling lazy?

Go ahead and buy a stirrer:
