> WARNING: Centrifuges are dangerous machines. Always make sure you detach the rotor from the motor when testing the device. Attach something to the motor only after you are confident that you have the machine working properly.

## Synopsys

Weâ€™ll try to isolate our first biomaterial. For that we need centrifugal force to take your samples for a spin. In class you will learn more about analog electronics and physical separation techniques.

## Schedule

* Electronics
* Fritzing documentation
* OpenSCAD
* Centrifugation
* Centrifuge design
* Centrifuge experiments
  * [DNA Extraction](/biofactory/class/5-centrifuge/DNA-extraction/)
  * [Chloroplast Isolation](/biofactory/class/5-centrifuge/chloroplast-isolation)

## Centrifuge Design

This week we will build the centrifuge. All the design files (Sketchup design, SVG laser cutting, Fritzing wiring and arduino code) can be found in the [Centrifuge repository](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Centrifuge). Alternatively, download  the whole centrifuge repository directly as a [zip archive](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Centrifuge/archive/master.zip).
The code also contains a number of examples, to test some components separately
