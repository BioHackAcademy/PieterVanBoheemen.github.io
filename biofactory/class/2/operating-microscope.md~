## Goal

This practical gives you insight in how a microscope works and how you can operate it.

## Microscope Parts

Let's start by taking a closer look at the parts of a microscope.

The final magnification of a microscope is equal to the multiple of the magnification of the lens and the objective. In the Open Wetlab microscopes the lens magnifies 10x and there are objectives for 4x, 10x, 40x and 100x magnification.

Underneath the stage a third lens setup can be found. This is the condenser. Using these lenses you can focus the light on the object. Using the diaphragm you can vary the intensity of the light too. Lower the intensity to increase the contrast.
