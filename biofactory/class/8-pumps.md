## Synopsys

The microbes in your bioreactor need fresh food. Let’s get rid of the manual feeding and connect syringe & peristaltic pumps. You will also learn more about feed stocks and other substrates. We’ll go a bit deeper into metabolic networks too.

## Schedule

* [Metabolic networks & flux analysis](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/pdf/1 Metabolic Flux Analysis.pdf)
* [Mechanical drive materials](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/pdf/2 Mechanical Design.pdf)
* [Pump designs](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/pdf/3 Pumps design.pdf)

## Pump Designs

This week you can build two types of pumps. As with the other projects, each of the devices has its own github repository.

### Some notes on the source files and designs
* Code: We have included the LiquidCrystal_I2C library. However, as there are multiple libraries named LiquidCrystal_I2C around on the web, if you have included one in your Arduino libraries directory it can result in a conflict (errors during compilation). Temporarily remove the library from your Arduino libraries directory.
* Peristaltic pump: the design of the pump depends on the diameter of the tube. In case you use a different type, you will need to adjust the diameters. In our design we used HelixMark™ tubes (internal diameter 6.35 mm; external diameter 9.55 mm)
* Syringe pump: the mounting interface between the pump and the syringe depends on the type of syringe you use. In our design we used a MediWare 60mL syringe (REF: I3 040800).

### Syringe pump

This pump is best for moving small volumes of liquids.

### Peristaltic pump

Peristaltic pumps are best used in continious flow systems or for pumping large volumes.

## Assignment

Answer the following questions in your documentation:

* What does the reactor do? What product has been made?
* From what designs is it derived?
* Which parts have been custom made, by what machine?
* What are all the components and how much do they cost?
* How is it assembled?
* What can be improved?
