## Synopsys

The microbes in your bioreactor need fresh food. Let’s get rid of the manual labour and connect syringe & peristaltic pumps. You will also learn more about feed stocks and other substrates. We’ll go a bit deeper into metabolic networks too.

## Schedule

* Metabolic networks & flux analysis
* Mechinical drive materials
* Syringe pump design
* Peristaltic pump design

## Pump Designs

This week we will two type of pumps. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/requirements/)
* Syringe pump design
  * [SketchUp assembly](/biofactory/class/8/Syringe-Pump-Sketchup.skp)
  * [SVG laser cut files](/biofactory/class/8/Syringe-Pump-SVGs.zip)
  * [Fritzing wiring]
  * [Arduino Code]
