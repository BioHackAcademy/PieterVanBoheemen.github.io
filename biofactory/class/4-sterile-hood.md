## Synopsys

In order to make it easier to work sterile with microbes, we will construct our own sterile hood. During class you will learn more about biological safety and how to purify strains.

## Schedule

* [Biohacking overview](/biofactory/class/4/pdf/1 History of Biohacking.pdf)
* [Biological safety instructions](/biofactory/class/4/pdf/2 Biosafety.pdf)
* [Sterile hoods, bio reactors and allowed spaces](/biofactory/class/4/pdf/3 Sterile hoods, bio reactors and allowed spaces.pdf)
* [Sterile Hood design](/biofactory/class/4/pdf/4 Flow hood design.pdf)
* [Open Source Biological Safety Cabinet](/biofactory/class/4/pdf/5 Presentation Hany & Veit.pdf)

## Sterile Hood Design

No Fritzing wiring this time, just connect the fan to the switch and plug.

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Sterile Hood materials](/biofactory/class/4-sterile-hood/sterile-hood-materials/)

## Assignment

1. Search for previous projects within the Biohack community regarding your biofactory and set up a small reference library on your Github Page.
2. Start growing your organism in a liquid culture.
