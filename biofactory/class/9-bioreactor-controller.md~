## Synopsys

Now that we have constructed pumps, stirrers and a spectrometer we can start connecting all the dots into one big bioreactor. The controller will be able to set the environmental parameters, input and analyse the effluent of your reactor. 

## Schedule

* Reactor assembly
* Inoculation and sampling
* Controller Design

## Reactor Controller Design

This week is all about Arduino code. We need to tie everything together into one mean machine.

* [Arduino code](/biofactory/class/19/reactor-controller-arduino-code.txt

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Reactor Controller materials](/biofactory/class/9-reactor-controller/controller-materials/)

## Assignment

Document your entire bioreactor, anwering the following questions:

* What does the reactor do? What product has been made?
* From what designs is it derived?
* How much does it cost?
* Which parts have been custom made, by what machine?
* What are all the components and how much do they cost?
* How is it assembled?
* What can be improved?

## Additional reading and hacking

* Reactor Design
  * 
* Controllers
  * 

## Feeling lazy?

Go ahead and buy a reactor controller:
