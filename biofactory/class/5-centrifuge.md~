## Synopsys

Weâ€™ll try to isolate our first biomaterial. For that we need centrifugal force to take your samples for a spin. In class you will learn more about analog electronics and physical separation techniques.

## Schedule

* Electronics
* Fritzing documentation
* OpenSCAD
* Centrifugation
* Centrifuge design

## Centrifuge Design

This week we will build the centrifuge. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/5-centrifuge/requirements/)
* SketchUp assembly
* SVG laser cut files
* [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/5/Centrifuge-Fritzing.fz)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Centrifuge materials](/biofactory/class/5-centrifuge/centrifuge-materials/)

## Assignment

Start sketching your bioreactor controller in Fritzing.

## Additional reading and hacking
