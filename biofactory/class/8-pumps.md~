## Synopsys

The microbes in your bioreactor need fresh food. Let’s get rid of the manual labour and connect syringe & peristaltic pumps. You will also learn more about feed stocks and other substrates. We’ll go a bit deeper into metabolic networks too.

## Schedule

* Metabolic networks & flux analysis
* Mechinical drive materials
* Syringe pump design
* Peristaltic pump design

## Pump Designs

This week we will two type of pumps. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/requirements/)
* Syringe pump design
  * SketchUp assembly
  * SVG laser cut files
  * [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/8/Syringe-Pump-Fritzing.fz)
* Peristaltic pump design
  * SketchUp assembly
  * SVG laser cut files
  * [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/8/Persistaltic-Pump-Fritzing.fz)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Syringe Pump materials](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/syringe-pump-materials/)
* [Peristaltic Pump materials](/biofactory/class/8-pumps/peristaltic-pump-materials/)

## Assignment

Document one of your devices in as an instructable.

## Additional reading and hacking

* Metabolomics
  * 
* DIY Syringe pumps
