## Synopsys

Now that we have constructed pumps, stirrers and a spectrometer we can start connecting all the dots into one big bioreactor. The controller will be able to set the environmental parameters, input and analyse the effluent of your reactor. 

## Schedule

* Reactor assembly
* Inoculation and sampling
* Controller Design

## Reactor Controller Design

This week is all about Arduino code. We need to tie everything together into one mean machine.
The github for the bioreactor can be found [here](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Bioreactor), or in [ZIP](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Bioreactor/archive/master.zip). It consists of:

* Flask, sitting on a heating pad to control temperature 
* Magnetic stirrer
* [Arduino program](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Bioreactor/tree/master/Arduino/Bioreactor), with a connection system to connect pumps and other devices.
* [Bioreactor control program](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Bioreactor/blob/master/BioreactorControl/BioreactorControl.pde) written in Processing

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Reactor Controller materials](/biofactory/class/9/bioreactor-materials/)

## Assignment

Prepare for the Graduation Show on April 21st.
